The *abstract factory* pattern allows the client to instantiate what he or she thinks are the same class, but in fact are subclasses with slight differences.  In other words, there is one superclass.  There are multiple sublcasses that all have the same interface, but somewhat different internal architecture.  Depending on what the client wants out of the object being created, the factory chooses which subclass to instantiate.
